## ✨ Features

### 🧠 3 Intelligent Translation Modes
LumenAI doesn't just do 1-to-1 translation. Choose the mode that fits your exact need:
*   **📚 Meaning (Dictionary) Mode**: Perfect for single words or short phrases. Provides rich dictionary-style definitions, parts of speech, synonyms, pronunciation guides, and visual emojis to help you grasp the true nuance.
*   **⚡ Direct Mode**: Fast, pure, native-sounding translation. Ideal for sentences, paragraphs, or when you just need the text translated accurately without extra fluff.
*   **🔍 Reverse Lookup**: Forgot a word? Describe it! Type "a place where you borrow books" and LumenAI will instantly find the target word for you (e.g., "Library") in your chosen language.

### ⚙️ Customizable AI Engines
Take full control over the AI powering your translations. You can mix and match models for different modes!
*   **Groq Inference Engine**: Blazing fast models including **Llama 3.3 70B**, **Llama 4 Scout**, and **Qwen 3**.
*   **Google AI**: Powerful models including **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite** and **Gemma 4**.

### 🎧 Audio & Voice Features
*   **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Speak directly into the app using native browser speech recognition.
*   **Smart Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
    *   **Native Accent Force**: Automatically detects and forces the *correct* regional voice (e.g., French voice for French text) to ensure perfect pronunciation.
    *   **Intelligent Reading**: In Meaning or Reverse mode, the AI smartly reads *only* the translated words/headwords, skipping the grammar metadata and markdown formatting.
    *   **Voice Quality**: Prioritizes high-quality Google/Microsoft neural voices if available on your device.

### 🎯 Precision Logic
*   **Auto-Detect Mastery**: Automatically identifies the input language and adapts its translation rules perfectly.
*   **Strict Language Enforcement**: Prevents "false friend" errors. If you explicitly select **German** but type "Gift" (which exists in English too), it forces the AI to treat it as German ("Poison") instead of guessing English ("Present").
*   **🎭 Context Button**: Add optional context notes (e.g., "formal email", "Gen Z slang", "medical document") to get the exact tone you need.

### 🚀 Key Capabilities
*   **🎨 Beautiful Glassmorphic UI**: Minimalist, elevated UI components with smooth animations and dark mode support that looks gorgeous on any device.
*   **📱 Installable App (PWA)**: Add to your mobile home screen and use it like a native iOS or Android app.
*   **💾 Local History**: Automatically saves your translations locally so you never lose your vocabulary lists.
