FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE EXACTLY LIKE THIS (use markdown for bolding and lists):

**[Corrected Word if typo, or Original Word]** [pronunciation]

1. [visual emoji] **[Translation in ${targetName}]** [*part of speech like noun, verb, adj., etc.*]
   [One line explanation in ${targetName} about when/how to use this meaning]
   *Example:* [A short example sentence in detected language using the original word]

2. [visual emoji] **[Alternative Translation]** [*part of speech*]
   [One line explanation in ${targetName}]
   *Example:* [Example sentence in detected language]

📝 **Note:** [Any special tips, cultural notes, or grammar tips - write in ${targetName}]

You MUST interpret the input as ${sourceName}, even if it looks like another language (e.g. 'Gift' in German = Poison, not Present).` : `- CRITICAL: Identify the language of the input text accurately and write it in the 'Detected Language' line.`}
- Use visual emojis that represent the meaning (🏦 for bank/money, 🌊 for river bank, 👋 for hello, 📚 for book, etc.)
- Put pronunciation in [brackets] right after the word
- Write ALL explanations in ${targetName} language! EXAMPLE LANG IS IN THE LANG OF THE WORD SEARCHED
- If the input has typos like "helo" or "bitte", correct it and show the proper spelling
- Include articles if important (der/die/das for German, etc.) and note them in the note section
- Be concise but informative
- DO NOT echo these rules back to the user. DO NOT output internal thoughts. Output ONLY the final requested format.`;
